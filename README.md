# Scrapify

Scrapify addresses a significant issue in the traditional scrap-selling process, where individuals and households often struggle with inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor pricing. In the conventional system, people typically rely on local scrap dealers, who may not always offer fair prices, and users often have no real bargaining power or understanding of the scrap’s market value. Additionally, the process can be time-consuming, inconvenient, and lacks the flexibility to compare multiple dealers or options.

For scrap dealers, the problem extends to missed opportunities for sourcing valuable scrap from a larger pool of sellers. Many dealers face difficulties in finding consistent suppliers or ensuring the quality and quantity of scrap materials. On both ends, the system lacks digital infrastructure, causing inefficiencies, limited access to real-time market data, and potential exploitation for sellers.

Scrapify solves these issues by creating an online platform that connects users with a network of scrap dealers. It introduces transparency by offering users the ability to compare dealers based on price, reviews, and service quality. Sellers no longer have to rely on a single dealer but can choose based on competitive offerings, ensuring they get the best possible deal. The platform also incentivizes users with "Green Points" to encourage more scrap selling and promote sustainable practices.

For scrap dealers, Scrapify provides access to a broader customer base, improving business opportunities and streamlining operations through digital transactions, route optimization, and efficient scrap sourcing. In essence, Scrapify transforms a disorganized, opaque market into an efficient, transparent, and eco-friendly digital ecosystem.
